## ngxs 最小化调试?

以最小的模块进行调试?

好像必须开一个ng-cli后注入来使用.



## rxjs 最小化调试

[文档](https://rxjs.dev/guide/overview)下F12 console中即可使用

ReactiveX combines the [Observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) with the [Iterator pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_pattern) and [functional programming with collections](http://martinfowler.com/articles/collection-pipeline/#NestedOperatorExpressions) to fill the need for an ideal way of managing sequences of events.

The **essential concepts** in RxJS which solve **async event management** are:

- **Observable:** represents the idea of an invokable collection of future values or events.
- **Observer:** is a collection of callbacks that knows how to listen to values delivered by the Observable.
- **Subscription:** represents the execution of an Observable, is primarily useful for **cancelling** the execution.
- **Operators:** are pure functions that enable a functional programming style of dealing with collections with operations like `map`, `filter`, `concat`, `reduce`, etc.
- **Subject:** is equivalent to an **EventEmitter**, and the only way of **multicasting(多播)** a value or event to multiple Observers.
- **Schedulers:** are centralized dispatchers to control concurrency, allowing us to coordinate when computation happens on e.g. `setTimeout` or `requestAnimationFrame` or others.
