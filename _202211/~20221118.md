# 100b 的 css reset

可以用于文字内容的博客基础样式

```css
html {
  max-width: 70ch;
  padding: 3em 1em;
  margin: auto;
  line-height: 1.75;
  font-size: 1.25em;
}
h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 {
  margin: 3em 0 1em;
}

p,ul,ol {
  margin-bottom: 2em;
  color: #1d1d1d;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

- `max-width: 70ch`: the “readable range” is usually 60-80 character widths, and CSS lets you express that directly with the `ch` unit. [I blogged more on line lengths last year](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1223025553986347009).
- `padding: 3em 1em`: If the display’s width goes under the `max-width` set above, then this padding prevents edge-to-edge text on mobile. We use `3em` to provide top/bottom whitespace.
- `margin: auto`: This is really all that is needed to center the page - applied on `html`, because Dan’s site doesnt have a semantic `` tag and `` is more likely to exist in most sites (no judgment pls, i’ve heard enough semantic HTML preaching). That the top tag centers itself relative to nothing is unintuitive, but thats how browsers do.
- `line-height: 1.75`: Spacing between the lines to help increase visual clarity. Always leave line height unitless because [reasons](https://twitter.com/JayGilmore/status/1449731397585879040).
- `font-size: 1.5em`: I’ve noticed that recent design trends and screen sizes have tended toward bigger font sizes. Or maybe I’m getting old. Prefer `em` or `rem` over `px` if you want to let users scale it.
