**如何返回包含随机数组的json**

## Using variables

You can use double curly braces to reference variables throughout Postman. For example, to reference a variable named "username" in your request authorization settings, you would use the following syntax with double curly braces around the name:

```js
{{username}}
```

When you run a request, Postman will resolve the variable and replace it with its current value.

For example, you could have a request URL referencing a variable as follows:

```js
https://postman-echo.com/get?customer_id={{cust_id}}
```

Postman will send whatever value you currently have stored for the `cust_id` variable when the request runs. If `cust_id` is currently `3`, the request will be sent to the following URL including the query parameter:

```js
https://postman-echo.com/get?customer_id=3
```

If you are want to access a variable from within a request body, wrap its reference in double-quotes:

```js
{ "customer_id" : "{{cust_id}}" }
```

You can use variables in request URLs, parameters, headers, authorization, body, and header presets.



上面是说在请求时可以使用变量..

怎么mock返回数据呢, 上面的变量似乎无法在response body中?
